# EC400 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence which deals with learning from repeated interactions with an environment. Reinforcement learning 
is the basis for state-of-the-art algorithms for playing strategy games such as Chess, Go, Backgammon, and Starcraft, as well as a number of problems throughout 
robotics and various fields of engineering and computer science. In this course, we will study the fundamental algorithms of reinforcement learning.
